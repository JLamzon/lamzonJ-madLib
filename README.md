//Mad Lib - data validation and play again

Peer Review: Arely Martinez -- The program works smoothly. There wasnt any errors with the data confirmation on the last part of the program (if the user wants to play again). Even if i enter different varaiations of no the data confirmation still works. It was smart to only validate no and have the users input set to lowercase (it shortens the code and looks neater ).
